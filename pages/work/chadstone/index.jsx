        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>Soon to be unveiling the mallâ€™s new shopping, dining &amp; entertainment precincts, Chadstone was keen to revisit their online presence and website in line with the new development. <OutboundLink to="http://inlight.com.au">Inlight</OutboundLink> was tasked with building a new website that offered information on stores, entertainment, events and an intuitive mapping solution.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>I was part of a development team that helped produce a solution over the space of a few months. I was mainly responsible for building components and UI in the build and handling application state, but also worked on the api. I am most proud of the getting there page, which included a Google Maps integration that helped users get to the shopping mall and provided taxi and Uber estimations.</p>
